# Statistical-Analysis-of-Rehoming-Time-for-Different-Dog-Breeds-in-Shelter 🐕


**Aim** 🎯

This project aims to analyze rehoming patterns of different dog breeds using records from animal shelters that receive stray, abandoned, or neglected dogs. The goal is to understand how rehoming time varies among breeds.

**Dataset Overview** 📊

The analysis uses a subset of a larger dataset containing approximately 670 entries. It includes information on several breeds such as Labrador Retrievers, Greyhounds, and Border Collies. Key variables include the duration it takes for dogs to be rehomed, their health status, age, breed, and reasons for shelter admission. The primary focus of this study is on the “Rehoming Time” and “Breed” attributes. The dataset utilized for this project is referred to as “dataset.”

**Tools Used 👩🏻‍💻**

R programming language

**Approach and Methodology 🪜**

* **Data Preprocessing:** Initial steps involved cleaning the data by eliminating rows with missing or invalid values.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** The dataset was segmented by breed, followed by exploration to identify key features across Labrador Retrievers, Greyhounds, and Border Collies.
* **Statistical Modeling:** Graphical methods were applied to propose suitable statistical distributions, which were then tested for goodness of fit on each breed subgroup.
* **Comparative Analysis:** The results were compared using Confidence Interval Forest Plots to evaluate differences in rehoming times between breed pairs, supporting final interpretations and conclusions.
